# Data-analysis on diamond dataset
# This is an example code implementation for "How to prepare database for large scale usuage."

# It covers the following sections:

## Data Preparation:
1. We use the diamonds_dataset.csv which gives the description about the various features of diamond such as id,colour,shape,cut,price,carat etc.
2. We had taken the first 150 rows as the part of our dataset.
3. We dropped the unwanted attributes such as url,report etc.
4.  We made the id column as index.

## Database Search:
1. We had search the features of diamond on the basis of id.
2. The id should be in integer otherwise it will not be accepted.

## To run the code:
1. Clone the repository of Github on your PC. 
2. Run the Data Preparation file to view the dataset as well as to search the features of diamond.
3. That's completed.
